ODDBALL RISING

looking in the mirror
can’t hold it forever
fingers crossed again

oddball rising
dancing in the shadows
an illusion of connection

I think, therefore, I am
future ashes in a can
earth to earth, dust to dust

grapevine out of LA
straight shot down the freeway
to the bay and back again

we were weirdos in the night
but when it’s right, it’s right
it is hard to comprehend

breaking bread, doing drugs
writing songs, making love
reaching for both ends

be true to who you are
you're dust from a distant star
future ashes in a can

"well, something’s lost but something’s gained"
yeah, that’s how the game is played
you better learn the rules or quit

because the game is infinite
so strap on in and hold on tight
we’re gonna ride it to the end

the times they are a-changin'
yeah, it’s a novel combination
of the same old deck of cards

they say life is what you make of it
you give or you don’t give a shit
you play the hand you’re dealt

I think, therefore, I am
future ashes in a can
earth to earth, dust to dust
